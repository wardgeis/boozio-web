# What we're building
Boozio is a social app for discovering and sharing drink ideas and recipes. We're aiming to build the most intuitive, accessible, and useful cocktails repository on the web.

## Built with Ember.js
We chose Ember as our framework because it's flexible and fast, yet rigid in the right places. Ember's emphasis on correct web functionality ensures our app will behave as users expect it to in a browser (ie, use sharable links and not break the back button) without forcing us to spend a lot of time building out mundane path structures and so forth. We'll also probably re-use a lot of this JavaScript in our early mobile apps.

## Dev Team Next steps:

[] Set up many-to-many relationship for drinks & ingredients
[] Create autocomplete interface for adding drinks
[] Build out drink and ingredient models
[] Integrate cloud backend
[] Add authentication layer
[] Build social functionality
[] Develop Admin console
[] Pretty up front end
[] Go live
